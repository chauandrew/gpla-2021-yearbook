It arrived at my house about an hour after she texted me, and I was so very happy because I hadn't had any real, quality boba milk tea (or any boba milk tea for that matter) since the quarantine began.

I know it was dreadful but I'm SO GRATEFUL/STILL CAN'T BELIEVE that you chose to stay with me in the ER.

Thank you for leading me out of some dark places and always showing grace, patience, and love. Thank you for maturing me and teaching me how to accept truth in order to grow (I honestly think you've helped me become more logical than I was before haha). With you and your prayers it's been easier handling problems and going to God. You always redirected me to the Word. Thank you for the playlist you made.

But I'm glad we talked through my though process and you using biblical truths and wisdom to provide a lot of guidance for me and showed me that I make quick decisions based on my feelings rather than in truth. Also wanna thank you for holding all of us accountable - it made me really uncomfortable at first but I realized that it was actually such a blessing for someone to really genuinely care about my spiritual state (even more than I do/did).

Everyone was excited and emotional because of NSWN, but Bob had the biggest smile I've ever seen on anyone, and I knew at that moment that all the hard work paid off. I knew at that moment that Bob was experiencing a joy that came from giving his all to the LORD that is incomparable to that of the world's lesser joys, and I remember feeling more joy from how joyful Bob was than from just my own joy.

In addition, I also really appreciated the focus time we had when we watched the youth pastor give tips on talking to the youth. For some reason, learning to improve my talking to youth skills never came to mind as a way to improve myself for God's kingdom, and it's in the little things like these that show just how much thought you both put in to trying to love us and the Interhigh kids, really thinking and responding to our needs.

For example, I'm grateful how frequently you opened your home this past year for study sessions before finals week, as well as teaching course 301. Recently, I'm thankful for how you helped galvanize the junior class with the USC preview service, as well as now advising us with NSWN planning. I hope that with this final year, that I can continue to grow under both yours and Bob's mentorship! ",

For example, you frequently ask how my brother is doing, and I'm thankful for that. I'm also really thankful for how open you are when talking about your own family and your experience in sharing the Gospel with them. ",

Some of us guys went on a short nature hike with Bob around the area and ended up seeing some deer. The woods covered in snow was really scenic and I think it was a chill time to just enjoy nature and be able to soak up some wisdom from our leader. ",

I think I'm often really stubborn or resistant when it comes to doing what's best for my spiritual health and growth, but you always keep me on the right path. I really appreciate that you have this vision for my life than often seems bigger than my own and that really motivates me. Even though you often have a lot on your plate, you're still able to make time to check up on me or listen when I need to talk to you about something. I'm super thankful that God has blessed me with a leader like you.",

The experience meant a lot to me and I learned so much about myself, about ministry, and from the Austin church. 50% of the team is now with/in the junior class so that's really neat!",

From going to Austin, doing transfer outreach, Caltech, and USC, I'm grateful for the opportunity to have served in so many places with you guys and to learn from you guys this year. I know how much our bros look up to you and I think it speaks a lot to the relationship you have with them! Thank you for being our spiritual parents and for always opening up your homes and lives to us!",
                "jocelyn": "Hi boss, I call you boss because you're one of the most independent, determined, and fierce people I have ever known, and that determination is something that you carry into your ministry with our class and others. Thanks for not being tired of us and always exhorting us through all our highs & lows. You are a source of truth, encouragement and spiritual advice in my life. I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to be ministered to by you and to do ministry with you in the past year. Not going to share too personally here but just wanted to let you know that the relationship we have is one of the best things that has ever happened to me. You're the best! :)",

Those few months of doing InterHigh with you & Abby & the rest of the summer team are some of the best memories I have of serving, and they serve as a consistent reminder to me of why I am so passionate about youth ministry. The kids at Somang opened up a lot after you and Abby started leading youth group, and I think that really speaks to the kindness and warmth that you radiate to the people around you. I have never seen the youth so excited and nervous until we were practicing the special performance for your wedding; it really shows how much of an impact you guys have had on them. Thank you for putting in so much effort into ministering to them and also to our peers, they are truly lucky to have you as a role model & leader to look up to! Looking forward to another dim sum reunion and our eventual visit to James' dad's \u7f8a\u8089\u4e32 store!",
                "abby": "Grandma Abs! Let's just say I am honored to have been your first visitor at the hospital canteen :) You are genuinely one of the gentlest and kindest people I know, and I have been so blessed through our many conversations over the summer as we traveled to and from InterHigh together. Thank you for opening up about parts of your testimony to me - I am still surprised sometimes of how similar our personalities and interests are. I am thankful that you were willing to share your time with me and that I had to opportunity to learn from your experiences and advice. My peers are lucky to have you as their home group leader! I am sad we don't get to serve at InterHigh together but I'm looking forward to the day we get to finally visit your apartment + do ministry together again!",

I didn't really get to know you until we went on the Austin mission trip together last summer, but I'm thankful we had the opportunity to co-labor for the gospel. Your impact on GPLA is quite profound, especially in the five (?) weddings we had last year within the church! Not sure what any of us would do without our professional choreographer haha. Thanks for sharing your talents with the church community and also for faithfully ministering to our class this year!",
                "jo": "Auntie JoJo! It didn't seem that long ago when we would make weekly ventures to 304 and sleepover on your carpet haha... I guess we're all in different stages now with us being upperclassmen and you being staff. I would've never thought that we'd get to interact this much and that you would end up being our staff / come to Caltech together. Thanks for all the Trader Joe snack deliveries, Sawtelle meals, and boba trips together, and for just being so open about your experiences in ministry. I appreciate what you've done for our class and for your constant efforts in reaching out to me! Your class has provided a great example for us to emulate as we become seniors and do more outreach next year!",
                "brianna": "Brianna! I'm grateful that I got to know you better this year through serving in Austin and doing transfer outreach together. I remember the conversations we had then and also when we shared our testimonies during the fall quarter KBBQ last fall. I appreciate how much you've done for our class and your willingness to share about your experiences with me!",
